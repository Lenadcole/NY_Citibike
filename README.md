# New York Citi Bike project

## Objective
Citi Bike is a bike-sharing service based in New York City in the U.S.
This project's objective is to conduct a descriptive analysis of publicly available data from Citi Bike to discover actionable insights for a business strategy team to use in order to make informed decisions about bike availability issues. With these issues under control, Citi Bike would be able to secure their position as a leader in eco-friendly transportation solutions in the city.

## Deliverable
I will produce and deploy a multi-page dashboard using Streamlit that will convey all appropriate information in a clear and concise manner.

## Data
I am using open source data from the [Citi Bike database for 2022](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html) and weather data from [NOAA's API service](https://www.noaa.gov/) . 

## Python libraries
